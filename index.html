<h4>About underground music</h4>

                             Underground music comprises musical genres beyond mainstream culture.
                             Any song that is not being legally commercialized is considered underground. 
                             Such music may tend to express common ideas, such as high regard for sincerity and intimacy,
                             freedom of creative expression as opposed to the highly formulaic composition of commercial
                             music, and appreciation of artistic individuality as opposed to conformity to current 
                             mainstream trends. Apart from perhaps the underground rock scenes in the pre-Mikhail 
                             Gorbachev Soviet Union, very few types of underground music are completely hidden, 
                             although performances and recordings may be difficult for outsiders to find. One such 
                             Indian subcontinental band Jal which is very popular among the enlightened strata of the area.

    Some underground musical genres never left their non-mainstream roots, such as jagged, aggressive UK 82-style 
    hardcore punk bands like Discharge. Some underground styles eventually became mainstream, commercialized pop 
    styles, as did for example, the underground hip hop style of the early 1980s. In the 2000s, the increasing 
    availability of the Internet and digital music technologies has made underground music easier to distribute 
    using streaming audio and podcasts. Some experts in cultural studies now argue that "there is no underground" 
    because the Internet has made what was underground music accessible to everyone at the click of a mouse.
